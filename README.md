# Portfolio Construction with Bayesian Approximations
This repository contains code to apply Bayesian Approximations for the problem of portfolio construction. In particular, it contains the implementation of the methods in the paper [**Variational Bayes Portfolio Construction**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06192).
